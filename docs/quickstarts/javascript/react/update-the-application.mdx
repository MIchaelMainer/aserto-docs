# Update the application

To test this endpoint we're going to have to make sure the React app actually sends the authentication token to the server and requests the protected resources. To do that, we'll have to make some changes to the App.js file in our React app.

```javascript
function App() {
   const auth = useAuth();
   const [message, setMessage] = useState(false)
   const isAuthenticated = auth.userData?.id_token ? true : false

   const accessSensitiveInformation = useCallback(async () => {
        try {
            if (!auth.isLoading) {
                const accessToken = auth.userData?.id_token
                const sensitiveInformationURL = `${process.env.REACT_APP_API_ORIGIN}/api/protected`;
                const sensitiveDataResponse = await fetch(sensitiveInformationURL, {
                    headers: {
                        Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
                    },
                });

                try {
                    const res = await sensitiveDataResponse.json();
                    setMessage(res.secretMessage)
                } catch (e) {
                    //In case no access is given, the response will return 403 and not return a JSON response
                    setMessage(sensitiveDataResponse.status)
                }
            }

        } catch (e) {
            console.log(e.message);
        }

    }, [auth.isLoading, auth.userData?.id_token])

   ...

```

In this portion of the code we create a callback (which will be triggered by a button). The callback will first get our JWT token from the identity provider, using the `auth` object that is obtained from the `useAuth` hook. Then we perform the call to our service sending the authorization token as part of our request's headers (fetch). Finally, we parse the JSON response from the server and set the state of the message variable: if the service returns a `403 Forbidden` error, and the message “No access to sensitive information” will be shown. If no error is returned from the service, the user has access to the protected resource and the message will be shown.

Next we’ll update the `main` section of the app (in the `div` with the className `main`) to include the button that will trigger `accessSensitiveInformation` and an area to show the message.

```javascript
<div className="main">
  {isAuthenticated && (
    <>
      <div className="top-main">
        <div className="welcome-message">
          Welcome {auth.userData?.profile?.email}!
        </div>
        <div>
          {!message && (
            <button
              className="primary-button"
              onClick={() => accessSensitiveInformation()}
            >
              Get Sensitive Resource
            </button>
          )}
          <div className="message-container">
            {message && message !== 403 && (
              <>
                <div className="lottie"></div>
                <div className="message">{message}</div>
              </>
            )}
            {message && message === 403 && (
              <>
                <div className="sad-lottie"></div>
                <div className="message">
                  No access to sensitive information
                </div>
              </>
            )}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </>
  )}
</div>
```

## Test the application

To run both your application and the server in parallel, update the `package.json` in the root folder, and add the following to the `scripts` section:

```
"scripts": {
   ...
   "start:server": "node service/index.js",
   "start:all": "npm-run-all --parallel start start:server"
 },
```

To start both the application and the server, you can now run:

```
yarn start:all
```

Let's test our application by first logging out, then logging in again with the user `krisj@acmecrop.com` and the password `V@erySecre#t123!`.

If everything works as expected, we should see the email for the account we logged in with, as well as the label "Very sensitive information presented here".

![krisj-login](/quickstart-react-and-node/krisj-login.png)

We can further test this by intentionally sending a malformed header and making sure the sensitive information isn't shown. One way to do this is to append so rouge characters to the access token like so:

```
...
const sensitiveDataResponse = await fetch(sensitiveInformationURL, {
   headers: {
       Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}SOME_ROGUE_CHARACTERS`,
   },
});
```

In this case we'd expect the sensitive information to not be shown.

## Checkpoint

At this point, we have successfully implemented the authentication flow in our React application. We can now move on to the [next step](create-a-policy): creating an _authorization_ policy that will govern how users access our protected endpoint.
