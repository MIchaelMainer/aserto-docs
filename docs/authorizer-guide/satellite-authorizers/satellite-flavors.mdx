# Satellite flavors

A couple of flavors of satellite authorizers are available:

- Onebox: a single-tenant, single policy authorizer with a built-in web UI, to be used as a developer workstation.
- Sidecar: a single-tenant, single policy authorizer without a web UI. The sidecar is the general satellite flavor with a small surface area, which can be used as a sidecar but also as a local service instance.

## Docker images
