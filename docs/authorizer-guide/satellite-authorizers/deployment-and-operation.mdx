# Deployment and Operation

Satellites can be deployed in various ways based on the application and target environment needs and requirements. In its most basic form, an authorizer is a Docker container instance, which can be deployed as a standalone service, sidecar, or development workstation.

A satellite always operates in the context of a (single) Aserto organization and is assigned a specific policy to serve. This information is provided to the satellite via a configuration file, which it uses to send a discovery call to the Aserto control plane.

## Running the authorizer

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

docker run \
-ti \
--rm \
--name aserto-one \
--platform=linux/amd64 \
-p 8282:8282 \
-p 8383:8383 \
-p 8484:8484 \
-p 8585:8585 \
-v $PWD/certs:/app/certs:rw \
-v $PWD/cfg:/app/cfg:ro \
-v $PWD/eds:/app/db:rw \
ghcr.io/aserto-dev/authorizer-sidecar:0.4.23 run \
--config-file /app/cfg/config.yaml
```
