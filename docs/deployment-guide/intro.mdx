# Introduction

Aserto supports multiple deployment models, which involve different tradeoffs:
* Use our hosted multi-tenant authorizer
* Deploy our edge authorizer as a microservice in your subnet
* Deploy our edge authorizer as a sidecar 

The first option is good for prototyping; when deploying your production application, 
we strongly recommend one of the other two.

## Hosted multi-tenant authorizer

Every Aserto tenant has access to our hosted authorizer. This is a great option for 
getting started, but not a great option for a production application, since your 
application makes an HTTPS call across the internet for every application request, 
introducing unpredictability in latency and availability. 

## Deploy the edge authorizer as a microservice in your subnet

For non-kubernetes deployments, you can deploy the Aserto edge authorizer as a 
microservice in your environment. This means that you have to manage the lifecycle of 
the service just like you manage the lifecycle of your application, but it gives you 
a low-latency path from your application to the authorizer, and removes your application's 
dependency on an external service.

## Deploy the edge authorizer as a sidecar

For kubernetes deployments, an attractive deployment model is to configure the 
Aserto authorizer as a sidecar container in your application's pod. This ensures the 
lowest latency and highest availability path between your application container and 
the authorizer, since the sidecar is deployed on the same Kubernetes node as your 
application.
