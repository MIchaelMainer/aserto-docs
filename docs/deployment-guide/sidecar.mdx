# Sidecar deployment

Deploying the edge authorizer as a sidecar involves the following steps:

1. Deploy the edge authorizer as a sidecar inside the Kubernets pod in which your application resides. This step is comprised of multiple sub tasks.

	1. Enable the protocol used to communicate between the application and the authorizer container, for which there are two options: gRPC or REST HTTPS.
	2. Enable TLS, since both protocol options require TLS to establish a trusted connection between the application and the authorizer, we need to provide application access to the CA certificate.
	3. Create a persisted volume to the authorizer to store the edge directory database file, so that data can survive pod restarts and updates.

2. Configure the authorizer so it can download the policy bundle from the policy registry
3. Create a job to synchronize the edge directory data from the shared hosted authorizer


> The examples shown, are using [traefik](https://traefik.io/) for ingress and [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) for X.509 certificate management, using Let's Encrypt as the certificate authority.
