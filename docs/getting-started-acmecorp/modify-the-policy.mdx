# Modify the Policy

So far, we were using a policy created by Aserto. Let’s modify this policy and learn how to update our changes in Aserto. To make changes to the policy, clone the Github repository created [previously](/docs/getting-started-acmecorp/setup-aserto#choose-a-source-code-provider). Open the cloned repository in your favorite IDE.

Let’s examine the files:

![policy-file-list](/getting-started-acmecorp/policy-file-list.png)

1. `data.json` includes all the role definitions used by the authorizer. Any additional data can be included here, and it will be made accessible to policies under the `data` object.
2. `.manifest` specifies the policy root (in this case, `peoplefinder`) as well as properties in `data.json` that we want to make available. In our example, the root “roles” is referenced since it is the root property in our `data.json` file.
3. All of the policies are under the `policies` directory.
4. The policies under the `__id` folder are policies for routes that have an `id` passed to them - e.g. `/api/users/:id`. In the following example, we’ll modify the `__id/put.rego` policy.
5. Note that the naming of the directories here is only a convention to make it easier to understand the structure of the policies, but all `.rego` will be loaded into the authorizer regardless of the folder structure.

Similar to the experiment we ran in the Aserto playground, we’re going to make use of the `attributes` a user has to refine the current `allowed` rule such that only a person from the “Sales Engagement Management” department would be allowed to make modifications to a user’s profile.

We’ll add another rule to this policy:

```
allowed {
	props = attributes.properties
	props.department == "Sales Engagement Management"
}
```

## Push to Github

To have the policy updated in Aserto, all we have to do is to commit our changes, tag a release and push it to Github.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated policy"
git tag v0.0.1
git push
git push --tags
```

This is the "Policy as Code" workflow - it allows us to make changes to our policy without having to make any changes or redeploy our application.

## Review the behavior in the application

We now expect Euan - who is a member of the “Sales Engagement Management” department - to be able to make updates to user details. Open the PeopleFinder, and select Euan in the profile switcher.

Now open the first user (Karin Lamb) and edit her phone number:

![karin-lamb-edit](/getting-started-acmecorp/karin-lamb-edit.png)

When you hit save _no errors should be shown_, since now this is a permitted operation for people from Euan’s department.

## Next Steps

Success! You've completed the main portion of this tutorial. The next two sections are optional: the first will take you through the process of connecting an Auth0 account (if you have one) to the application, and lastly we'll review using the OneBox environment for local development.
