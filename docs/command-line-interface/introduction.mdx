# The Aserto CLI

Along with the Aserto Console and the API, the `aserto` CLI is one of the primary ways
that developers interact with Aserto.

The CLI has three main functions:
* Manage [organization](/docs/overview/organization) artifacts (policies, directory, connections)
* Interact with an [Authorizer](/docs/overview/authorizer)
* Manage the local developer experience [OneBox](/docs/command-line-interface/onebox)

All management operations are done in the context of an Aserto [*organization*](/docs/overview/organization).
