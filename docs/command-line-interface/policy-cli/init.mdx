# Creating a Policy

:::note
In order to create a policy, you must first set up a [Github PAT](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
:::

To create a new policy, use the `policy init` command:

```
policy init
```

You'll be asked to select a server:

```
  #  SERVER
  1  opcr.io

> Select server#:
```

Select the `opcr.io` server.

```
> user  : (rschwabco):
```

Provide your Github PAT:

```
> github secret name: (GITHUB_TOKEN):
```

Specify the name of the repository you'll be pushing the policy to:

```
> repo  : (): [YOUR-ORGANIZATION]/[POLICY-NAME]
```

The following directory structure will be created:

```
.
├── .github
│   ├── config.yaml
│   └── workflows
│       └── build-release-policy.yaml
├── .gitignore
└── src
    ├── .manifest
    └── policies
        └── hello.rego
```

Update the content of the policy as needed, then follow the steps to [build](/docs/command-line-interface/policy-cli/build), [tag](/docs/command-line-interface/policy-cli/tag) and [push](/docs/command-line-interface/policy-cli/push) the policy to OPCR.
