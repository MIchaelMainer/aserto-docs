# Decision Logs

Decision logs are records of the decisions performed by Aserto authorizers that are collected into a central location 
by the Aserto control plane. Both hosted and sidecar authorizers can generate decision logs for policies that have them
enabled.

Decision logs can be accessed through the Aserto API and the Aserto CLI. Both of these methods support downloading data
as storage objects as well as a near-real-time data stream.

Storage objects hold decision log data for an extended period of time, are not real-time, and are immutable. They can 
be used to efficiently feed analytics systems such as Elasticsearch.

Data streams hold data for a short period of time, are near real-time and can be used to feed into data streaming
systems or to build applications that require up-to-the-minute data.

Decision logs can be configured and accessed in several ways:
* [Console](/docs/decision-logs-guide/console): GUI for enabling, disabling and viewing decision logs
* [API](/docs/decision-logs-guide/api): find and retrieve decision log data
* [CLI](/docs/command-line-interface/decision-logs): automate decision logs data retrieval



## Accessing Decision Logs through the CLI

Immutable storage objects are created roughly once an hour for each policy for which decision logging is enabled and for which decision activity exists during that time period. The storage are CSV files containing decision log events; each one corresponding to a decision performed by some authorizer. Objects for one, more (or all) policies can be discovered and then downloaded individually using the API or CLI. The CLI also supports bulk downloads.

### Listing Objects

```
aserto login
aserto decision-logs list [--policies=<policy-id1>,<policy-id2>...<policy-idN>]
```

### Fetch a Download URL

For each decision log object name, a download URL can be obtained. The download URL can be used to perform a standard HTTP download.

```
aserto login
aserto decision-logs get --info <object name>
```

### Bulk Downloads

The Aserto CLI can also perform bulk downloads, which can be useful when automating ingestion of decision log objects into analytics tools.

```
aserto decision-logs get [--path <destination path>] [--policies <policy-id1>,<policy-id2>...<policyi-idN>]
```

When this way, the CLI will only download decision log objects which don't already exist in the destination path.

## Other Storage Objects

Asertoâ€™s decision logging system maintains versioned copies of users and policies involved in decisions. These can be accessed using the Aserto API and CLI.

### Listing User Objects

```
aserto decision-logs list-users
```

### Fetch a Download URL

For each user object name, a download URL can be obtained. The download URL can be used to perform a standard HTTP download.

```
aserto decision-logs get-user --info <object name>
```

### Bulk Downloads

The Aserto CLI can also perform bulk downloads, which can be useful when automating ingestion of data referenced by decision log objects.

```
aserto decision-logs get-users [--path <destination path>]
```

When used this way, the CLI will only download objects that have changed since last downloaded, according to the metadata on the local versions and remote versions of the objects.
