# Github connection can't be removed

## Problem

When attempting to remove a Github connection, I get the error "E10037 entity is not empty".

![error-entity-not-empty](/troubleshooting/error-entity-not-empty.png)

## Solution

Remove all the policies associated with the Github account before disconnecting it.
