# Leaked secret keys

## Problem

I found out that any of the secret keys for my policy have been leaked or otherwise compromised.

## Solution

1. Go the Policies tab and open the policy for which keys have been leaked.
2. Click the "Rotate key" button for any of the leaked keys.

3. Update your application with the newely generated keys.
